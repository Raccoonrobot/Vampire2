        <h4>September 2, 2022</h4>
        <p> Max played for Tyler, was super creepy in game, def a previous vampire. You calmed some fights during the Elysem party hosted by Queen Anne Bowesly. Resulting in gaining a hunting ground from Caleb. You stopped Adisa from going feral and now she will likely be an ally. The Queen told you her task in exchange for  the "Seal" is to MURDER Valarius, her sire. She is not too concenred with the seal itself, but rather, seems to be concerned about what info you may have in regards to Mithras. <br>
            <br>
             Additonally, there was a weird flashback where you aiding Valarius in winning 
            the contest to be the baddest vamps so he could turn Anne. 'Milton' AKA Max, pulled some serious creep skills out to horrifiy any and all bystanders, "smoking a excised finger like a cigar" to give a mild insight to his depravity. His odd dream like memory concluded with The embrace of Anne Bowsley, soon to become a very influencial Kindred. </p>
