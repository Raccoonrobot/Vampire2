        <h4>July 1, 2022</h4>
        <p>After discoveering the "metal bird" hovering outside the window, the team decided to run. Jack jumped, yes jumped out the window. Luckily he landed on a flat roof, wheres Jason and Milton decided to encourage Shirazi to leave with them and turned down a dark hallway to a back exit. Loud bangs couls be heard everywhere, this was definatly a raid. WHilst on the roof Mickey was observed getting staking and drug into a black van, possible never to be seen again. nce on the roof a small dingy could be seen in the canal. Against Jasons desires the team headed to the boat to escaspe the swat like forces via a waterway. <br>
            <br>Upon arrival the team observed two less capable looking enemies. A step above beat cops, they were subdued with ease, offering some moderate tactical gear for Jack to change into, and two small handguns. Once a substanial amount of distance was gained, the team disembarked and headed out the the smelly streets of London. Dracula, and "vegan" vamp still needed no-human sustanace. Of how fortuidious the was a pet shop called "Happy Tails, full of chihuahuas, and one snake. Changing into a rat he snuck under the locked double doors and proceeded to murder all the canines inside. He decided to break open the pythons enclosure to make it appear to be the work of the reptile, though had to recalculate his escape, as a snake who didn't just eat 23 puppies would likely be too hungry to ignore a rat trying to flee the scene of a crime. He decided f-it and changed into a bear and broke therw the glass doors, making it look like a very strange, bt more traditional bulgery instead. <br>
            After all were fed of various poor nearby souls, the group stayed the day at the "shaky cup tavern" a dank and low caliber b and b, but it had great personality. and B and B.
           During the esacpe Shirazi lost some of the precious documents Desilvo tried to save, took photos with your new phones, and decided to gice them as a gift to the Queen. Useful info could be just what to get the woman who has evrything she could ever want, or pry from someone elses relectant hands.  You made it to the Party at queen Annes gawdy skyscraper, got in some fights then everyone got too drunk to do much else. actually a great game. </p>
