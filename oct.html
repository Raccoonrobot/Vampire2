        <h4>October 7, 2022</h4>
        <p>This game begins with the team waking up in the vault in the safe house belonging to Queen Anne Bowsley. With moderatly full bellies, the team decides to travel to the police station under Miltons dominion, near the outskirts of toen adjacent to South Hall. 
            Upon arrival, Milton is greeted warmly by the Dept as they believe he is in fact their Cheif of police, when they have been working with a body double day walker, to keep up appearances. After looking through "his" office a college offers up some concerning information about a gang of youths that apear to be injuring townsfolk nearby, then drinking there blodd or attemping to cannbalise them. The regular occult task force found this not "spooky" enough to investigate, but this man has a hunch.... <br>
            <br>
            He is persuaded that "special agent Jack", (Dracula) has been sent to investgate this very matter and willing hands over his report. The two Kindred head back out to the waiting vehicle to check on these poss duskborns causing potential masquerade violations in your new empire! Or your domain, i dunno, ya'll seems pretty upset and agressive about it. 
            <br>
            You come across the youths engaged in an attack on another mortal, Jack (real Jack) shoot everyone, and the interrogation begins. The pitifull Vamp claims this is Sri Sansas grounds if anything, but mostly nuetral territory, though you correct him that it is in fact YOUR lands now and proceed to inform evryone you cross of this 4 hour old info. You head to Blue Monsoon Tavern, and perform the same song and dance causing all vampire patrons to exit. One passeraby hands you a pamplet with info on Sri Sansa, and the local library where he hosts a meeting weekly for his mortal followers.
